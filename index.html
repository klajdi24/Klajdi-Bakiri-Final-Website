        <h3>Radial Design</h3>
        <p class="image-description">This design is a type of visual composition where elements radiate outward 
            from a central point, creating a circular pattern. I used the space on the page well and
             distributed information in a balanced fashion.

        <h3>Axial Design</h3>
        <p class="image-description">The Axial Design is a type of visual composition characterized 
            by clear and dominant axis, this design approach emphasizes balance and stability. I used symmetry well as elements are arranged on either side creating 
            a sense of equilibrium.

        <h3>Bilateral Design</h3>
        <p class="image-description">Bilateral design refers to a visual composition where elements 
            are arranged in a symmetrical manner on either side of a central axis. I chose a simle design to represent this style gives off a 
            professional and clean design.

        <h3>Dilatational Design</h3>
        <p class="image-description">Dilational Design is a creative approach that involves expansion, openness, and a 
            willingness to explore new possibilities. This design proved to be challenging in placing the content in an aesthetic position, however i am happy with the colours and overall style.</p>

        <img class="grid-design" src="images/GRID DESIGN.jpg" alt="Grid Design">
        <h3>Grid Design</h3>
        <p class="image-description">Grid Design refers to a layout that uses a grid system, this style may appear borind and basic however gives a sense of order in visual communication,
            I was a ble to fill the page well using the content and give an organised look to the style.

        <img class="modular-design" src="images/MODULAR DESIGN.jpg" alt="Modular Design">
        <h3>Modular Design</h3>
        <p class="image-description">The Modular design  is an approach to design that involves creating a system or structure composed of independent, self-contained units or modules.
         I wanted to give a lighter coloured style and create a creative background using the colours i was allowed to use.

        <img class="random-design" src="images/RANDOM DESIGN.jpg" alt="Random Design">
        <h3>Random Design</h3>
        <p class="image-description">The Random design shows a distribution of information shown in a not ordered pattern, i chose to have the elements cascading from the top left of the page to the bottom right using different fonts and sizes.

    <div class="image-card">
        <img class="transitional-design" src="images/TRANSITIONAL DESIGN.jpg" alt="Transitional Design">
        <h3>Transitional Design</h3>
        <p class="image-description">Transitional design, in a broad sense, refers to a style that incorporates elements from both traditional and modern design aesthetics. I used a bright yellow as i thought it would allow the design to be eye catching, and filled the page well, using cirles and lines which were warped to give an aesthetic look.

<button>Skateboard Poster </button>
<div class="image-card">
    <img class="skateboard" src="images/Skateboard.jpg" alt="Skateboard">
    <h3>CARP Project</h3>
    <p class="image-description"> This Skateboard Poster was created using CARP, my choice of colours for content was a yellow outline paired with bacl which i thought went well
        with the background. I added effects on the text such as inner glow and drop shadow to add depth and texture, and make the poster overall stand out.I created a colourful puff with added texture and outer glow to make it stand out and really display the content intended, I used contrast well as the text on it is in bold black which really catches the eye of the viewer.
        I faded a picture of another skateboard to fill the bottom of the page which goes well with the background og the original image. I aligned the text to fill the page and display the information in an appropriate manner.
