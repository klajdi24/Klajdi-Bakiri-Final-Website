        <h3>Radial Design</h3>
        <p class="image-description">This design is a type of visual composition where elements radiate outward 
            from a central point, creating a circular pattern. I used the space on the page well and
             distributed information in a balanced fashion.

        <img class="axial-design" src="images/AXIAL DESIGN.jpg" alt="Axial Design">
        <h3>Axial Design</h3>
        <p class="image-description">The Axial Design is a type of visual composition characterized 
            by clear and dominant axis, this design approach emphasizes balance and stability. I used symmetry well as elements are arranged on either side creating 
            a sense of equilibrium.

        <h3>Bilateral Design</h3>
        <p class="image-description">Bilateral design refers to a visual composition where elements 
            are arranged in a symmetrical manner on either side of a central axis. I chose a simle design to represent this style gives off a 
            professional and clean design.

        <h3>Dilatational Design</h3>
        <p class="image-description">Dilational Design is a creative approach that involves expansion, openness, and a 
            willingness to explore new possibilities. This design proved to be challenging in placing the content in an aesthetic position, however i am happy with the colours and overall style.</p>

        <img class="grid-design" src="images/GRID DESIGN.jpg" alt="Grid Design">
        <h3>Grid Design</h3>
        <p class="image-description">Grid Design refers to a layout that uses a grid system, this style may appear borind and basic however gives a sense of order in visual communication,
            I was a ble to fill the page well using the content and give an organised look to the style.

        <h3>Modular Design</h3>
        <p class="image-description">The Modular design  is an approach to design that involves creating a system or structure composed of independent, self-contained units or modules.
         I wanted to give a lighter coloured style and create a creative background using the colours i was allowed to use.

        <img class="random-design" src="images/RANDOM DESIGN.jpg" alt="Random Design">
        <h3>Random Design</h3>
        <p class="image-description">The Random design shows a distribution of information shown in a not ordered pattern, i chose to have the elements cascading from the top left of the page to the bottom right using different fonts and sizes.

        <img class="transitional-design" src="images/TRANSITIONAL DESIGN.jpg" alt="Transitional Design">
        <h3>Transitional Design</h3>
        <p class="image-description">Transitional design, in a broad sense, refers to a style that incorporates elements from both traditional and modern design aesthetics. I used a bright yellow as i thought it would allow the design to be eye catching, and filled the page well, using cirles and lines which were warped to give an aesthetic look.

    <h3>CARP Project</h3>
    <p class="image-description"> This Skateboard Poster was created using CARP, my choice of colours for content was a yellow outline paired with bacl which i thought went well
        with the background. I added effects on the text such as inner glow and drop shadow to add depth and texture, and make the poster overall stand out.I created a colourful puff with added texture and outer glow to make it stand out and really display the content intended, I used contrast well as the text on it is in bold black which really catches the eye of the viewer.
        I faded a picture of another skateboard to fill the bottom of the page which goes well with the background og the original image. I aligned the text to fill the page and display the information in an appropriate manner.

        <h2>Reflective Essay</h2>
        <p>
            This project proved to be tough due to the amount of new material and having to become familiar with different software’s such as GitHub, Illustrator and InDesign. These software’s proved to be crucial in the making of this project.
I learned the different types of typographic systems and got a good understanding of them by looking at different examples posted by my teacher on blackboard, which helped inspire my designs. I created these typographic designs using illustrator which was a challenge at first as it was new to me. Out of the 8 designs I think my most successful was the Radial design as I was able to make use of the space and fill the page for it to be balanced as the content is displayed, paired with the circles and lines that give colour and dynamic to the design. We were restricted by only using one other colour other than black which added to the challenge. My least successful design was the Random design as I didn’t make good use of the space in the bottom left and top right of the page to give it a fuller look, I also didn’t use different types of shapes and only stuck to triangles which made the design to be quite simplistic.
In my CARP project I got to learn how to use InDesign which proved to be quite difficult getting the picture into the right frame to fit on the canvas. I experimented using different fonts to see what fit with the picture of the girl on the skateboard, I used Minion Pro and Bernard MT font a few times to display the content paired with black and yellow colours that contrasted well with the background. I faded a picture of another person skating to fill the bottom bit of the page, allowing it to look as one image. I made use of effects such as drop shadow and inner glow which I used on the text to make it jump out of the page. I created a puff paired with drop shadow to emphasize certain elements of the poster such as the text which draws attention to key information while creating depth and texture.
My website displays all my work from my coding worksheets that helped me get familiar with coding and using GitHub to present my pieces. The typographic designs and Carp project is displayed. The Website design is simplistic and lacks depth however it is able to display the required contents in a readble and appropriate way. The navigation of the website is straightforward as very few buttons are used. Overall i think the website could have been more complex with more buttons and pages however i will need to improve in my ability to code to add that complexity.
